\begin{enumerate}
\item Four cards are drawn successively with replacement from a well shuffled deck of 52 cards.What is the probability that\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item all the four cards are spades ?\\
\item only 2 cards are spades?
\end{enumerate}
\item A pair of dice is thrown four times. If getting a doublet is considered a success,find the probablity distribution of number of successes. Hence find the mean of distribution.


\item In answering a question on multiple choice test,a student either knows the answer or guesses. Let $\frac{3}{5}$ be the probability that he knows the answer and $\frac{2}{5}$ be the probability that he guesses.Assuming that a student who guesses at the answer will be correct with the probability of $\frac{1}{3}$. What is the probability that the student knows the answer given that he answered it correctly?
\end{enumerate}
