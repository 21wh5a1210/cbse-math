\begin{enumerate}
\item Two different dice are tossed together. Find the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top of the dice is $6$.
\item A card is drawn at random from a well-shuffled deck of playing cards. Find the probability that the card drawn is
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item a card of spade or an ace.
     \item a black king. 
     \item neither a jack nor a king.
     \item either a king or a queen
 \end{enumerate}
\item A bag contains, white, black and red balls only. A ball is drawn at random from the bag. If the probability of getting a white balls is $\dfrac{3}{10}$ and that of black ball is $\dfrac{2}{5}$, then find the probability of getting a red ball. If the bag contains $20$ black balls, then find the total number of balls in the bag.
