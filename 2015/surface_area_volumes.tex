\begin{enumerate}
\item Due to sudden floods, some welfare associations jointly requested the government to get $100$ tents fixed immediately and offered to contribute $ 50\% $ of the cost. If the lower part of each tent is of the form of a cylinder of diameter $4.2$ m and height $4$ m with the conical upper part of same diameter but of height $2.8$ m, and the canvas to be used costs \rupee $100$ per sq. m, find the amount, the associations will have to pay. What values are shown by these associations ? [Use $\pi=\dfrac{22}{7}$]
\item A hemispherical bowl of internal diameter $36$ cm contains liquid. This liquid is filled into $72$ cylindrical bottles of diameter $6$ cm. Find the height of the each bottle, if $10 \% $ liquid is wasted in this transfer.
\item A cubical block of side $10$ cm is surmounted by a hemisphere. What is the largest diameter that the hemisphere can have ? Find the cost of painting the total surface area of the solid so formed, at the rate of \rupee $5$ per $100$ sq. cm. [Use $\pi= 3.14$]
\item $504$ cones, each of diameter $3.5$ cm and height $3$ cm, are melted and recast into a metallic sphere. Find the diameter of the sphere and hence find its surface area. [Use $\pi=\dfrac{22}{7}$]


\item Find the area of the minor segment of a circle of radius $14$ cm, when its central angle is $60 \degree.$ Also find the area of the corresponding major segment. [Use $\pi =\dfrac{22}{7}$]
\item In \ref{Figure 5}, $PQRS$ is a square lawn with side $PQ = 42$ metres. Two circular flower beds are there on the sides $PS$ and $QR$ with centre at $O$, the intersection of its diagonals. Find the total area of the two flower beds (shaded parts).

\item From each end of a solid metal cylinder, metal was scooped out in hemispherical form of same diameter. The height of the cylinder is $10$ cm and its base is of radius $4.2$ cm. The rest of the cylinder is melted and converted into a cylindrical wire of $1.4$ cm thickness. Find the length of the wire. [Use $ \pi=\frac{22}{7} $]
\item The diagonal of a rectangular field is $16$ metres more than the shorter side. If the longer side is $14$ metres more than the shorter side, then find the lengths of the sides of the field.
