   \item  The angle of elevation of an aeroplane from a point $A$ on the ground is $60\degree$. After a flight of $15$ seconds, the angle of elevation changes to $30\degree$. If the  aeroplane is flying at a constant height of $1500\sqrt{3}$ m,find the speed of the plane in km/hr.

   \item At a point $A$, $20$ metres above the level of water in a lake, the angle of elevation of a cloud is $30\degree $. The angle of depression of the reflection of the cloud in the lake, at $A$ is $60\degree $. Find the distance of the cloud from $A$.
