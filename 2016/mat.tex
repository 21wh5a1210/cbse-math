\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $A$ is a square matrix such that $\abs{A} = 5$, write the value of 
$\abs{AA^{\text{T}}}$

	\item $A = \myvec{1 & 2 \\ 3 & -1}$ and $B = \myvec{1 & -4 \\ 3 & -2}$, find $\abs{AB}$.

	\item If $A = \myvec{0 & 3 \\ 2 & -5}$ and $KA = \myvec{0 & 4a \\ -8 & 5b}$ find the values of $k$ and $a$.

	\item Ishan wants to donate a rectangular plot of land for a school in his village. When he was asked to give dimensions of the plot, he told that if its length is decreased by $50m$ and breadth is increased by $50m$, then its area will remain same, but if length is decreased by $10m$ and breadth is decreased by $20m$, then its area will decrease by $5300m^2$. Using matrices, find the dimensions of the plot. Also give reason why he wants to donate the plot for a school.

	\item Using the properties of determinants, prove that:
	\begin{align*}
		\mydet{(b+c)^2 & a^2 & bc \\
		(c+a)^2 & b^2 & ca\\
		(a+b)^2 & c^2 & ab} = (a - b) (b-c) (c-a) (a+b+c) (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)
	\end{align*}
	
	\item Using elementary row operations, find the inverse of the following matrix :
	\begin{align*}
		A = \myvec{2 & -1 & 3\\
		-5 & 3 & 1 \\
		-3 & 2 & 3}
	\end{align*}



	\item If $A = \myvec{\cos \alpha & \sin \alpha\\ -\sin \alpha & \cos \alpha}$, find $\alpha$ satisfying $0<\alpha<\frac{1}{2}$ when $A + A^{\text{T}} = \sqrt{2}I_{2}$, where $A^{\text{T}}$ is transpose of $A$

	\item If $A$ is a $3\times3$ matrix and $\abs{3A} = k \abs{A}$ then write the value of $k$

	\item Using properties of determinants, prove that
	\begin{align*}
		\mydet{(x + y)^2 & zx & zy \\
		zx & (z+y)^2 & xy \\
		zy & xy & (z+x)^2}
		 = 2xyz (x + y + z)^3
	\end{align*}
	
	\item If 
	\begin{align*}
		A = \myvec{1 & 0 & 2\\
		0 & 2 & 1 \\
		2 & 0 & 3}
	\end{align*}
and $A^3-6A^2+7A+kI_3=0$ find $k$.
