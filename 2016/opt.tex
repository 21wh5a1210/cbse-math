\begin{enumerate}
	\item A diet is to contain at least $80$ units of Vitamin $A$ and $100$ units of minerals. 
Two foods $\text{F}_1$ and $\text{F}_2$ are available costing $5$ rupees per unit and $6$ rupees per unit respectively. 
One unit of food $\text{F}_1$ contains $4$ units of vitamin $A$ and $3$ units of minerals whereas
 one unit of food $\text{F}_2$ contains $3$ units of vitamin $A$ and $6$ units of minerals. 
 Formulate this as a linear programming problem. Find the minimum cost of diet that consists of mixture of these two foods and also meets minimum nutritional requirement.
 
 
 	\item  A retired person wants to invest an amount of $50,000$ rupees. His broker recommends investing in two type of bonds $A$ and $B$ yielding $10\%$ and $9\%$ return respectively on the invested amount. He decides to invest at least
$20,000$ rupees in bond $A$ and at least $10,000$ rupees in bond $B$. He also wants to invest at least as much in bond $A$ as in bond $B$. Solve this linear programming problem graphically to maximise his returns.

	\item A typist charges $145$ rupees for typing $10$ English and $3$ Hindi pages, while charges for typing $3$ English and $10$ Hindi pages are $180$ rupees. Using matrices, 
find the charges of typing one English and one Hindi page separately. 
However typist charged only $2$ rupees per page from a poor student Shayam for $5$ Hindi pages.
How mcuh less was charged from ths poor boy? which values are reflected in this problem?
