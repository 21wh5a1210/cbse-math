\begin{enumerate}
\item A company produces two types of goods, $A$ and $B$, that require gold and silver. Each unit of type $A$ requires $3g$ of silver and $1g$ of gold, while that of type $B$ requires $1g$ of silver and $2g$ of gold. The company can use at most $9g$ of silver and $8g$ of gold. If each unit of type $A$ brings a profit of \rupee 40 and that of type $B$ \rupee 50, find the number of units of each type that the company should produce to maximize profit. Formulate the above Linear Programming Problem \brak{LPP} and solve it graphically. Also, find the maximum profit.       
\end{enumerate}
