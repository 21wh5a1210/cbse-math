\begin{enumerate}

\item Show that the height of the cylinder of  maximum volume that can be inscribed in a sphere of radious $R$ is $\dfrac{2R}{\sqrt{3}}$.Also find the maximum volume.
\item Find the equation of the line passing through \brak{2,-1, 2} and ${(5, 3, 4)}$ and of the plane passing through \brak{2, 0, 3}, \brak{1, 1, 5} and \brak{3, 2, 4}. Also, find their point of intersection.
