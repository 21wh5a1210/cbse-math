\begin{enumerate}

\item A coin is tossed $5$ times. What is the probability of getting (i) $3$ heads,
 (ii) at most $3$ heads ?
\item Find the probability distribution of $X$, the number of heads in a simultaneous toss of two coins.
\item If $P\brak{not A} =0.7, P\brak{B}=0.7$ and $P\brak{B\mid A}=0.5$, then find $P\brak{A\mid B}$.
\item A bag contains $5$ red and $4$ black balls, a second bag contains $3$ red and $6$ black balls. One of the two bags is selected at random and two balls are drawn at random \brak{without replacement} both of which are found to be red. Find the probability that the balls are drawn from the second bag.      
\end{enumerate}
