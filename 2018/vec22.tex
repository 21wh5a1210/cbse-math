
\item Find the value of y for which the  distance between the points $\brak{2,-3}$ and $\brak{10,y}$ is $10$ units.
\item if the point $\brak{0,2}$ is equidistant from the points $\brak{3,k}$ and $\brak{k,5}$, find the value of $k$.
\item The line segment joining the points $A\brak{2,1}$ and $B\brak{5,-8}$ is trisected at the points P and Q, where P is nearer to A. If P lies on the line $2x-y+k=0$, find the value of K.
\item The x-coordinate of a point $P$ is twice its y-coordinate. If $P$ is equidistant from the points $Q\brak{2,-5}$ and $R\brak{-3,6}$, find the coordinates of $P$.
