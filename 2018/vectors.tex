\begin{enumerate}


\item A line passes through the point with position vector 
$2\hat{i} - \hat{j} + 4\hat{k} $ and is the direction of the vector 
$\hat{i} + \hat{j} - 2\hat{k} $. 
Find the equation of the line in cartesian form.

\item Show that the points 
A\brak{-2\hat{i} + 3\hat{j} + 5\hat{k}},B\brak{\hat{i} + 2\hat{j} + 3\hat{k}}
and C\brak{7\hat{i} -\hat{k} } are collinear.

\item Find
$|\overrightarrow{a} \times \overrightarrow{b}|$,
if $\overrightarrow{a}=2\hat{i}+\hat{j}+3\hat{k}$ and
$\overrightarrow{b}=3\hat{i}+5\hat{j}-2\hat{k}$.   

\item The scalar product of the vector 
$\overrightarrow{a} = \hat{i} + \hat{j} + \hat{k}$
with a unit vector along the sum of the vector 
$\overrightarrow{b} = 2\hat{i} + 4\hat{j} - 5\hat{k}$ and
$\overrightarrow{c} = \lambda \hat{i} + 2\hat{j} + 3\hat{k}$ 
is equal to $1$. Find the value of $\lambda$ and hence find 
the unit vector along 
$\overrightarrow{b} + \overrightarrow{c}$.

\item Find the vector and cartesian equations of the plane
passing through the points having position vectors 
$\hat{i} + \hat{ j} - 2\hat{k}$, $2\hat{i}-\hat{j} + \hat{k}$ 
and $\hat{i} + 2\hat{j} + \hat{k}$. Write the equation of the 
plane passing through a point \brak{2,3,7} and parllel to 
the plane obtained above. Hence, find the distance between the 
two parallel planes.

\item Find the direction cosine of the line which makes 
equal angles with the coordinate axes. 

\item If the line 
$\dfrac{x-1}{-3} = \dfrac{y-2}{2\lambda} = \dfrac{z-3}{2} $ and 
$\dfrac{x-1}{3\lambda} = \dfrac{y-1}{2}  = \dfrac{z-6}{-5}$ 
are perpendicular, find the value of $\lambda$. 
Hence find whether the lines are intersecting or not.
