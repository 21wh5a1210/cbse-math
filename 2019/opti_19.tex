\begin{enumerate}
\item A company produces two types of goods, $A$ and $B$, that require gold and silver. Each unit of type $A$ requires $3$ g of silver and $1$ g of gold while that of type $B$ requires $1$ g of silver and $2$ g of gold. The company can use at the most $9$ g of silver and $8$ g of gold. If each unit of type $A$ brings a profit of \rupee $40$ and that of type $B$ \rupee $50$, find the number of units of each type that the company should produce to maximize profit. Formulate the above LPP and solve it graphically and also find the maximum profit.

\item Show that the height of the cylinder of maximum volume that can be inscribed in a sphere of radius $R$ is $\frac{2R}{\sqrt{3}}$. Also find the maximum volume.

\item The volume of a cube is increasing at the rate of $8 cm^3/s$. How fast is the surface area increasing when the length of its edge is $12 cm$ ?
\end{enumerate}
