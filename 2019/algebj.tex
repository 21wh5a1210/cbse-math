\item Find the quadratic polynomial, sum and product of whose zeroes are $-1$ and $-20$ respectively. Also find the zeroes of the polynomial so obtained.

\item Sum of the areas of two squares is $157 m^2$. If the sum of their perimeters is $68 m$, find the sides of the two squares.

\item A plane left $30$ minutes later than the scheduled time and in order to reach its destination $1500 km$ away on time, it has to increase its speed by $250 km/hr$ from its usual speed. Find the usual speed of the plane.

\item A motorboat whose speed is $18$ km/hr in still water takes one hour more to go $24 km$ upstream than to return downstream to the same spot. Find the speed of the stream.

\item Solve for $x$ :
\begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{2a+ b +2x} = \frac{1}{2a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{2x}; x\neq0, x\neq\frac{-2a-b}{2}, a, b\neq0
