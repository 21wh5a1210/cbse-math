\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the solution of the pair of equations :
\begin{align*}
    \frac{3}{x}+\frac{8}{y}=-1; \frac{1}{x}-\frac{2}{y}=2, x, y\neq 0
\end{align*}

\item Find the value(s) of $k$ for which the pair of equations
\begin{align*}
    kx+2y=3\\
3x+6y=10
\end{align*}
has a unique solution.
\item Sumit is $3$ times as old as his son. Five years later, he shall be two and a half times as old as his son. How old is Sumit at present ?

 \item Find the value(s) of $k$ so that the pair of equations $x + 2y = 5$ and $3x + ky + 15 = 0$ has a unique solution.

 \item For what value of $k$, will the following pair of equations have infinitely many solutions :
\begin{align*}
