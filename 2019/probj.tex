\begin{enumerate}
\item A bag contains $15$ balls, out of which some are white and the others are black. If the probability of drawing a black ball at random from the bag is $\frac{2}{3}$, then find how many white balls are there in the bag.

\item A card is drawn at random from a pack of $52$ playing cards. Find the probability of drawing a card which is neither a spade nor a king.

\item A die is thrown once. Find the probability of getting
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a prime number
    \item an odd number. 
\end{enumerate}

\item Three different coins are tossed simultaneously. Find the probability of getting exactly one head.
