\begin{enumerate}
\item In $\triangle ABC$ \figref{fig:Fig_2}, $AD \perp BC$. Prove that\\
$AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2BC \times BD $

\item Draw a circle of radius $4$ cm. From a point $6$ cm away from its centre, construct a pair of tangents to the circle and measure their lengths.

\item Construct a triangle with sides $5cm$, $6cm$ and $7cm$ and then another triangle whose sides are $\frac{3}{5}$ of the corresponding sides of the first triangle.

\item Let $\triangle ABC  \thicksim  \triangle DEF$  and their areas be respectively, $64cm^2$ and $121cm^2$. If $EF=15.4cm$, find $BC$.

\item Prove that the sum of the squares of the sides of a rhombus is equal to the sum of the squares of its diagonals. 

\item In \figref{fig:Fig_3}, $BL$ and $CM$ are medians of a $\triangle ABC$ right-angled at $A$. Prove that $4(BL^2 + CM^2)= 5 BC^2$.
